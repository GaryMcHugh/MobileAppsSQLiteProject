# Mobile Applications Project

## Introduction
I have created a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application using SQLite for this project. The application is designed to be used by an employer to keep track of their employeeâ€™s names, 
contact details and salaries. An easy to use interface allows the user to easily navigate through the application and Add, Update and Delete Employees as they wish.
I have used the MVVM structure in this project to separate out my classes. The use of a command bar allows for easy navigation to and from the home page. 
This project uses various things I learned from the labs such as MVVM, SQLite, Observable Collections and Lambda expressions. 
The files 'SQLite.cs' and 'SQLiteAsync.cs' are publicly available files that I used to create this project. I found them at the following link:
